# SimonIT-Share-Automation
An app that helps automate the recording uploading process for the Simon IT Help Desk

This code takes a list of class recording URL's pasted into the GUI and publishes them according to Simon IT Help Desk formatting
Due to ECHO's built-in share automation, I don't imagine many other people will find a use for this code, but if this is something
that you want to do for your own project, I imagine you could minimally alter the code and still have it work

DO NOT add in extra blank lines between URLs, nor more than 1 blank line after the last URL

config.txt must be formatted correctly and present in the directory the code runs from. See the example config file and the formatting
instructions in the comments at the top of the source code for further detail
